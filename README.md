# Fashion MNIST in Keras

*Using neural networks to identify clothing items!*

In this project, we will demonstrate how to use the Keras neural network library to perform image classification on the [*Fashion MNIST* dataset from *Zalando*](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). We will initially demonstrate how we can use a multilayer perceptron model to achieve 89.65% accuracy on the test set. 

The project was based off of the [Keras MNIST tutorial](https://github.com/wxs/keras-mnist-tutorial) by [wxs](https://github.com/wxs).

If you want to get this running on your own computer, please refer to the [Keras installation guide](https://keras.io/#installation) for the details on how to install Keras on your machine.
